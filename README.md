# Spotify Save Hotkey
---

##### SpotifySaveHotkey is an application that lets you save the music you're listening to with the push of a button!

## Why?
I love to listen to new music, and I love to listen to music *while I'm busy doing other things.* The **problem** is that Spotify doesn't give you an easy way to save a song ***without minimizing what you're doing***.

### What are we going to do??
***Install SpotifySaveHotkey!***
* [Windows Installer](https://github.com/JBarna/SpotifySaveHotkey/releases/download/v1.0/SpotifySaveHotkey_WindowsInstaller.EXE)
* [Mac Installer](https://github.com/JBarna/SpotifySaveHotkey/wiki/Mac-Installation)

### How it works
Once isntalled you should see a checkmark in your task tray, then you can 
* `hover over` - the icon to see what current hotkey is set
* `right click` - the icon to access options and change the hotkey
